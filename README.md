#Final320Project
Baltimore is well-known to be an extremely dangerous city with a high crime rate. This fact influenced us to choose the "Baltimore 911 Calls" Kaggle Dataset since all of us live within 20 minutes of Baltimore and this data can have a personal influence as to where we decide to live following graduation. There is a lot of useful and interesting information such as the types of calls coming from different regions, the dates during which the crimes happen, and how the police system prioritizes different crimes. We can use this information to inform potential residents like ourselves as to what regions have higher and lower rates of serious crimes, and the police system can use this information to distribute their resources accordingly. Furthermore, the conclusions we gather from this dataset can help assist the police systems in how to prepare for crimes in certain districts and the number of officers that should be on duty at a certain time.
