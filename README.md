Baltimore is well-known to be an extremely dangerous city with a high crime rate. This fact influenced us to choose the 
"Baltimore 911 Calls" Kaggle Dataset. There is a lot of useful and interesting information such as the types of calls 
coming from different regions, the dates during which the crimes happen, and how the police system prioritizes different crimes. 
We can use this information to inform potential residents like ourselves as to what regions have higher and lower rates of serious 
crimes, and the police system can use this information to distribute their resources accordingly. Furthermore, the conclusions 
we gather from this dataset can help assist the police systems in how to prepare for crimes in certain districts and the 
number of officers that should be on duty at a certain time.
